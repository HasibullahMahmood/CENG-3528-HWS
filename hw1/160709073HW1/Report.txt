Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases.
It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger
item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. Wikipedia

The algorithm is implemented in Java programming language line by line using pseudocode from Bing Liu Book.
ArrayList and HashMap data structures are used in implementation.

Method Name #1:	main(String[] args)
Description: 	Accepts two arguments(MinSupport and FilePath) as input from CMD, runs Apriori Algorithm and prints all frequent item sets.

Method Name #2: readFile(String path)
Description: 	Accepts one argument(filePath), reads transactions line by line, removes spaces and split items by comma and returns Transactions as ArrayList.

Method Name #3:	runApriori(ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> Transactions, double minSup)
Description: 	Accepts two arguments(Transactions and MinSupport), using initPass method it gains all items and its frequents
		if item support is greater than MinSup adds it to f1, then f1 to F, generates new candidates, counts candidate repetition in transactions
		add candidates to FK if their actual support is greater than MinSupport and finally returns frequent item sets as HashMap(Key, value).

Method Name #4:	initPass(ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> Transactions)
Description:  	Accepts transactions as argument, iterates each item, if item does not contain in HashMap add it, else counts item's repetition
		and finally returns each item with it's frequent

Method Name #5: candidateGen(HashMap<ArrayList<String>, Double> FK_1)
Description: 	Accepts one argument(fk-1), sort keys(items) in ascending order, checks if last element of both list are different, 
		then checks if rest of elements in both lists are equal, if true joins f1 and f2, checks the subset of new candidate in fk-1,
		if true adds it to CK and return it.

Most probably there is no bug in the program and it will run fine.
